# rs_lisp

An interpreter for the Lisp langauge, written in Rust

# Why

Why not? Actually, the real reason is to practice some Rust

# Consideration

This isn't (and surely won't be) a well-written Rust program, since my language
knowledge requires lots of refinement. This is my attempt to dig deeper
into this great language (Lisp, of course ;-))

# TODOs

- [x] implement the lexer
- [ ] write the grammar
- [ ] implement the parser
- [ ] evaluate the code
- [ ] refactor the code
- [ ] all the others fancy staff that make a programming langague useful
